# 🤖 Sidewalk-Following Robot 🚶‍♀️

This project features an autonomous robot designed to follow sidewalks using **OpenCV** for path detection and an **Arduino** for motor control. The robot uses a webcam for visual input, which is processed on a Windows PC to detect and follow paths, then sends movement commands to the Arduino via USB serial. The motors are controlled to steer and drive the robot along the sidewalk.

## 🚀 Features:
- 🌟 **Open-source C++ code** for path detection using OpenCV.
- 🎮 **Arduino-controlled movement** via serial communication.
- 🛠️ **Easy-to-upload INO file** to Arduino for motor control.
- 🏃‍♂️ Designed for **autonomous operation** with continuous movement.
- 📹 Utilizes **webcam video input** to follow sidewalks in real time.

## 📋 Setup Instructions:

1. **Install OpenCV** for C++ on your Windows PC. [Follow this guide](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d3/d52/tutorial_windows_install.html) to install OpenCV.
   
2. Clone the repository and navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sidewalk-following-robot.git
   cd sidewalk-following-robot
